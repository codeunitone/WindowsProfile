# Terminal

This is the User Settings of my VC Code

## Prerequisites

You have to have VS Code installed

Needed Extensions:
- Bracket Pair Colorizer 2
- Dracula Official
- GitLense
- Material Icon Theme
- PowerShell
- SQL Server (mssql)
- ToDo Tree
- waldo CRS AL Language Extension

## Installation

Run `install.ps1` to install the profile

The installation script will create a link from `$VSCodeSettingsFolder\settings.json` to the `settings.json` located in this folder.
It will also create a backup of you existing `settings.json` file. The backup file is `$VSCodeSettingsFolder\settings.json-bak`.
