# Terminal

This is the User Settings of my VS Code

## Prerequisites

You have to have VS Code installed

Needed Extensions:

- [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)
- [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/)

## Installation

Run `install.ps1` to install the profile

The installation script will create a link from `$VSCodeSettingsFolder\settings.json` to the `settings.json` located in this folder.
It will also create a backup of you existing `settings.json` file. The backup file is `$VSCodeSettingsFolder\settings.json-bak`.
